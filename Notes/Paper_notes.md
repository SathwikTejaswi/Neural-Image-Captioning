### BLEU score

BLEU stands for bilingual evaluaton understudy. It is used for rating the machine translated sentences i.e, to obtain a jugement on how good or bad the machine translation is. The main criteia for jusging is "How close is the machine translated sentence to that of a human translated sentence?".

BLEU scores are between 0 to 1, where 1 indicates a very good translation score. BLEU uses can use a unigram(rarely) or an n-gram approach to compare the actual sentences with the candidate translations. BLEU makes use of a metric very similar to the precision score.
